## How popular is Yoshino Nanjou?

Ayane Sakura and Yoshino Nanjou are both well-known voice actresses in Japan, but they are recognized for different reasons, making it difficult to compare their fame directly.

Ayane Sakura is a younger voice actress who has been active in the industry since the late 2000s. She has voiced many popular characters in anime, such as Ochaco Uraraka in "My Hero Academia", Natsumi Koshigaya in "Non Non Biyori", and Gabi Braun in "Attack on Titan". Sakura's fame has grown significantly in recent years due to her involvement in high-profile anime series, making her one of the more prominent younger voice actresses today.

Yoshino Nanjou is also a voice actress but is perhaps equally or more known for her work as a singer. She is a member of the musical group fripSide and also played a significant role as Eli Ayase in the "Love Live!" franchise. Her work in "Love Live!" and her music career have given her a strong fanbase, particularly among fans of anime music and idol culture.

Fame Comparison:

Ayane Sakura might be more famous in the context of general anime fandom, especially for those who follow contemporary, popular anime series.
Yoshino Nanjou has a strong following, especially among fans of "Love Live!" and those who are into anime music.
In summary, while both are famous, their fame may vary depending on the context—anime voice acting vs. anime music/idol culture.
